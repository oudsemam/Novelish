# Novelish

Novelish is the product of 3 book loving full stack graduates of Grand Circus, based in West Michigan. Be sure to check back for new features currently in development, like creating your own shelves, advanced searching, tracking progress in your books, and adding notes.

## Motivation

As avid readers ourselves, we found the existing apps for tracking and finding new books to be lacking in several areas. We wanted to create a user experience that was simple and easy to use, and allowed us to save and organize our book lists, first and foremost. Future development includes enhanced features for searching based on user reviews around specific categories, sharing what you're currently reading, and customized shelves for organization.
